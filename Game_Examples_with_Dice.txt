Mario Party


From Z:

Mino Dice  - dice have faces like 
1, 1 , 1, 2, 7, flag
Rock, Rock, Rock, 4, 5, flag
Paper, paper, paper, 3, 4, flag
Etc...

Dice forge - actual literal modular Dice you edit as you progress through the game

Eclipse - weapon types have different hit values, most dice are 3x blank, 3x single hit, and there are some that have 4x blank, 2x 4 hits, some that have 2 blank 4 double hits, etc could be misremembering

Reavers/ champions of Midgard- all dice types have different faces that mean different things. Reavers has more commonality between die faces, champions has more variety and varying hit values

Batman: Arkham Chronicles - ok this is a stretch considering it's like a $300 board game but it's got something similar to eclipse, each type of dice has a different hit spread and hit count per hit, with variance in those, too
